  - Ensure that you are using the environment `cv_proj6`, which you can install using the install script `conda/install.sh`.

  2. ```mamba env create -f environment.yml``` or ```conda env create -f environment.yml```
  3. ```conda activate cv_proj6```
  4. go back to your Project6 folder, ```pip install -e .```
- If both methods above don't work well, you can try to create the environment by using conda and pip install:
  1. make sure you are in the Project6/conda folder, then enter those commands in the terminal.
  2. ```conda create -n cv_proj6 python=3.11.0```
  3. ```conda activate cv_proj6```
  4. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
  5. go back to your Project6 folder, ```pip install -e .```
